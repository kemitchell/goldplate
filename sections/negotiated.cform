    # California Civil Code 1654 (2016)
    #     In cases of uncertainty not removed by the preceding rules,
    #     the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly
    #     against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.

    # California Civil Code 1636:
    #     A contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the
    #     mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of
    #     contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.

    # California Civil Code 1638
    #     The language of a contract is to govern its interpretation,
    #     if the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve
    #     an absurdity.

    # California Civil Code 1639
    #     When a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of
    #     the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,
    #     if possible; subject, however, to the other provisions of
    #     this Title.

    # California Civil Jury Instruction 320 (2016):
    #     In determining the meaning of the words of the contract,
    #     you must first consider all of the other instructions that
    #     I have given you. If, after considering these instructions,
    #     you still cannot agree on the meaning of the words, then you
    #     should interpret the contract against [the party that drafted
    #     the disputed words/the party that caused the uncertainty].

    #     - "The trial court's instruction...embodies a general
    #       rule of contract interpretation that was applicable to
    #       the negotiated agreement between [the parties]. It may
    #       well be that in a particular situation the discussions and
    #       exchanges between the parties in the negotiation process
    #       may make it difficult or even impossible for the jury to
    #       determine which party caused a particular contractual
    #       ambiguity to exist, but this added complexity does not
    #       make the underlying rule irrelevant or inappropriate
    #       for a jury instruction. We conclude, accordingly,
    #       that the trial court here did not err in instructing
    #       the jury on Civil Code section 1654's general rule of
    #       contract interpretation." (City of Hope National Medical

    \ Negotiated Terms \ Each <Party> reviewed, and had a chance to negotiate, every provision of this <Agreement>. Words of uncertain meaning will not be interpreted more strongly against the <Party> that drafted them for that reason alone.
